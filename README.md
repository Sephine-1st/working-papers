### *Awarded Thesis*
"Apport des réseaux neuronaux au provisionnement IARD : Application d’architectures récurrentes à la prédiction d’évolution temporelle de montants"
I studied the inputs and contribution of neural networks to P&C reserving and I have offered the implementation of a reserving model using recurrent neural networks, which are fitted to sequential data and have the ability to learn long-term dependencies.

## 2024 February : AI in the worplace: Is the use of data and AI in the workplace in service of the employees? (GOMA-LEGERNARD and MASSE)
Discution paper part of the law and ethics of AI curriculum, probing into the differentiation of Artificial Intelligence from previous automations and exploring the dynamics behind the use of Data Science in the workforce

## 2024 September : Methods and State of the Art: The Role of Transformer Models and RAG in the Implementation of Virtual Assistants Leveraging LLMs.
I Explorated RAG techniques and Transformer-based methods for developing virtual assistants powered by LLMs, including the design of an innovative client solution and tackling challenging table data.
